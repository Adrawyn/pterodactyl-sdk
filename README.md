## Install

To install the SDK in your project you need to require the package via [composer](http://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require hcgcloud/pterodactyl-sdk
```

Then use Composer's autoload:

```php
require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
```

And finally create an instance of the SDK:

```php
$pterodactyl = new \HCGCloud\Pterodactyl\Pterodactyl(API_KEY_HERE, BASE_URI_HERE);
```

## Usage

Using the pterodactyl instance you may perform multiple actions as well as retrieve the different resources Pterodactyl's API provides:

```php
$servers = $pterodactyl->servers();
```

This will give you an array of servers that you have access to, each server is represented by an instance of `HCGCloud\Pterodactyl\Resources\Server`, this instance has multiple public
properties like `$name`, `$id`, `$owner`, `$memory`, and others.

You may also retrieve a single server using:

```php
$server = $pterodactyl->server(SERVER_ID_HERE);
```

On multiple actions supported by this SDK you may need to pass some parameters, for example when creating a new server:

```php
$server = $pterodactyl->createServer([
    "external_id" => "4",
    "name" => "APITest",
    "user" => 1,
    "egg" => 15,
    "pack" => 0,
    "docker_image" => "hub.tencentyun.com/unihc/pterodactyl_images:vcmp",
    "environment" => [
        //Not confirmed
        [
            "server_id" => "",
            "variable_id" => "",
            "variable_value" => ""
        ]
    ],
    "skip_scripts" => false,
    "limits" => [
        "memory" => 64,
        "swap" => 0,
        "disk" => 64,
        "io" => 500,
        "cpu" => 0
    ],
    "feature_limits" => [
        "databases" => 0,
        "allocations" => 0
    ],
    "startup" => "./mpsvrrel64 -port {{SERVER_PORT}}",
    "description" => "test description",
    "node_id" => 1,
    "nest_id" => 5,
    "allocation" => [
        "default" => "16",
        "additional" => [
            "17",
            "18"
        ]
    ]
]);
```

These parameters will be used in the POST request sent to Pterodactyl servers, you can find more information about the parameters needed in panel source: `app\Http\Requests\Api\Application\Servers\StoreServerRequest.php`

Notice that this request for example will only start the server creation process, your server might need a few minutes before it completes provisioning, you'll need to check
the Server's `$installed` property to know if it's ready or not yet.

## Managing Users(Currently not totally upgraded to support 0.7.x & tested)

```php
$pterodactyl->users();
$pterodactyl->user($userId);
$pterodactyl->userex($userExternalId);
$pterodactyl->createUser(array $data);
$pterodactyl->deleteUser($userId);
```

On a User instance you may also call:

```php
$user->delete();
```

## Managing Servers

```php
$pterodactyl->servers();
$pterodactyl->server($serverId);
$pterodactyl->serverEx($serverExternalId);
$pterodactyl->createServer(array $data);
$pterodactyl->deleteServer($serverId);

// Server access
$pterodactyl->suspendServer($serverId);
$pterodactyl->unsuspendServer($serverId);
$pterodactyl->reinstallServer($serverId);
$pterodactyl->rebuildServer($serverId);

// Server Variable
$pterodactyl->updateServerStartup($serverId, array $data);
```

On a Server instance you may also call:

```php
$server->delete();
$server->suspend();
$server->unsuspend();
$server->reinstall();
$server->rebuild();
```
